fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world! How are you?");
}

// fn main - main function. This function is special in
// Rust - it is automatically executed when you run
// your programme/code. Anything inside this main function
// will be executed. 

// the go to in Rust is 4 spaces rather than a tab

// println - print a line 

// exclamation mark - macro 

// "Hello, world!" - this is what will be printed

// semi colon ; - terminates a line 

// { }  - what's executed in the main function
